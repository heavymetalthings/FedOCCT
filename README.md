# FedOCCT
Configuring Fedora for developing with OCCT.

## Overview
Let's keep it simple : 
The goal of this project is to provide and maintain an open-source software relying on Open Cascade technology.

This software is needed to perform four tasks:
- CAD
- Assemblies
- FEA
- CAM

If any of the previous is missing, it will make the whole thing kind of useless.
If all the elements are present, it will make it a worthy opponent to any of todays CAD/CAM softwares.

## Installing the tools



## Installing the dependancies

## Building OCCT

In this section, we are going to learn how to make the OCCT files.

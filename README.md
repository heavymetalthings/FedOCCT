# FedOCCT
Configuring Fedora for developing with OCCT.

## Overview
Let's keep it simple : 
The goal of this project is to provide and maintain an open-source software relying on Open Cascade technology.

This software is needed to perform four tasks:
- CAD
- Assemblies
- FEA
- CAM

If any of the previous is missing, it will make the whole thing kind of useless.
If all the elements are present, it will make it a worthy opponent to any of todays CAD/CAM softwares.

Also, the software will ave to be :
- Ergonomic an easy to use
- Pleasant to the eye

## Installing the tools

First of all, we are, as the name might suggest it, using Fedora (currently 37), and hence all the commands are aimed at this specific distro.

The IDE were are using is VSCodium (https://vscodium.com/).
Even though it is written in javascript, it truly is a polyvalent tool, very enjoyable to use, and easily manageable.

VSCodium has a builtin functionality that allows you to sync a github repo (named source control).

For monitoring the resources of our computer, we use HTOP.

Git is installed for working with github from the terminal.

Ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings (is a console file manager with VI key bindings)

Kitty is a GPU based terminal emulator (that I like to use in my tiling window manager, but that's another story)
